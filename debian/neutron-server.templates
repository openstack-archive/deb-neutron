_Description: Register Neutron in the Keystone endpoint catalog?
 Each OpenStack service (each API) should be registered in order to be
 accessible. This is done using "keystone service-create" and "keystone
 endpoint-create". This can be done automatically now.

 Note that you will need to have an up and running Keystone server on which to
 connect using a known admin project name, admin username and password. The
 admin auth token is not used anymore.
