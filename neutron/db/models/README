This directory is designed to contain all SQLAlchemy models shipped with core
Neutron.

* The expected directory structure is flat, except for the ML2 plugins. All ML2
  plugin models should fall under the plugins subdirectory (i.e. plugins/ml2/gre_allocation).
* Module names should use singular forms for nouns (port.py, not ports.py).
