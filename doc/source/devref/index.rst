In the Developer Guide, you will find information on Neutron's lower level
programming APIs. There are sections that cover the core pieces of Neutron,
including its database, message queue, and scheduler components. There are
also subsections that describe specific plugins inside Neutron. Finally,
the developer guide includes information about Neutron testing infrastructure.
