Sub-Project Guidelines
======================

This document provides guidance for those who maintain projects that consume
main neutron or neutron advanced services repositories as a dependency. It is
not meant to describe projects that are not tightly coupled with Neutron code.

Code Reuse
----------

At all times, avoid using any Neutron symbols that are explicitly marked as
private (those have an underscore at the start of their names).

Try to avoid copy pasting the code from Neutron to extend it. Instead, rely on
enormous number of different plugin entry points provided by Neutron (L2 agent
extensions, API extensions, service plugins, core plugins, ML2 mechanism
drivers, etc.)

Requirements
------------

Neutron dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subprojects usually depend on neutron repositories, by using -e git://...
schema to define such a dependency. The dependency *must not* be present in
requirements lists though, and instead belongs to tox.ini deps section. This is
because next pbr library releases do not guarantee -e git://... dependencies
will work.

You may still put some versioned neutron dependency in your requirements list
to indicate the dependency for anyone who packages your subproject.

Explicit dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each neutron project maintains its own lists of requirements. Subprojects that
depend on neutron while directly using some of those libraries that neutron
maintains as its dependencies must not rely on the fact that neutron will pull
the needed dependencies for them. Direct library usage requires that this
library is mentioned in requirements lists of the subproject.

The reason to duplicate those dependencies is that neutron team does not stick
to any backwards compatibility strategy in regards to requirements lists, and
is free to drop any of those dependencies at any time, breaking anyone who
could rely on those libraries to be pulled by neutron itself.

Automated requirements updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At all times, subprojects that use neutron as a dependency should make sure
their dependencies do not conflict with neutron's ones.

Core neutron projects maintain their requirements lists by utilizing a
so-called proposal bot. To keep your subproject in sync with neutron, it is
highly recommended that you register your project in
openstack/requirements:projects.txt file to enable the bot to update
requirements for you.

Once a subproject opts in global requirements synchronization, it should enable
check-requirements jobs in project-config. For example, see `this patch
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/215671/>`_.

Stable branches
---------------

Stable branches for subprojects should be created at the same time when
corresponding neutron stable branches are created. This is to avoid situations
when a postponed cut-off results in a stable branch that contains some patches
that belong to the next release. This would require reverting patches, and this
is something you should avoid.

Make sure your neutron dependency uses corresponding stable branch for neutron,
not master.

Note that to keep requirements in sync with core neutron repositories in stable
branches, you should make sure that your project is registered in
openstack/requirements:projects.txt *for the branch in question*.

Subproject stable branches are supervised by horizontal `neutron-stable-maint
team <https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/539,members>`_.

More info on stable branch process can be found on `the following page
<http://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/stable-branches.html>`_.

Stable merge requirements
-------------------------

Merges into stable branches are handled by members of the `neutron-stable-maint
gerrit group <https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/539,members>`_. The
reason for this is to ensure consistency among stable branches, and compliance
with policies for stable backports.

For sub-projects who participate in the Neutron Stadium effort and who also
create and utilize stable branches, there is an expectation around what is
allowed to be merged in these stable branches. The Stadium projects should be
following the stable branch policies as defined by on the `Stable Branch wiki
<http://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/stable-branches.html>`_. This
means that, among other things, no features are allowed to be backported into
stable branches.

Releases
--------

It is suggested that sub-projects release new tarballs on PyPI from time to
time, especially for stable branches. It will make the life of packagers and
other consumers of your code easier.

It is highly suggested that you do not strip pieces of the source tree (tests,
executables, tools) before releasing on PyPI: those missing pieces may be
needed to validate the package, or make the packaging easier or more complete.
As a rule of thumb, don't strip anything from the source tree unless completely
needed.

Sub-Project Release Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only members of the `neutron-release
<https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/150,members>`_ gerrit group can do
the following release related tasks:

* Make releases
* Create stable branches
* Make stable branches end of life

Make sure you talk to a member of neutron-release to perform these tasks.

To release a sub-project, follow the following steps:

* For projects which have not moved to post-versioning, we need to push an
  alpha tag to avoid pbr complaining. A member of the neutron-release group
  will handle this.
* A sub-project owner should modify setup.cfg to remove the version (if you
  have one), which moves your project to post-versioning, similar to all the
  other Neutron projects. You can skip this step if you don't have a version in
  setup.cfg.
* A sub-project owner `proposes
  <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/releases/tree/README.rst>`_ a patch
  to openstack/releases repository with the intended git hash. `The Neutron
  release liaison <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CrossProjectLiaisons#Release_management>`_
  should be added in Gerrit to the list of reviewers for the patch.
* If the subproject is not `managed
  <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/release_managed.html>`_ by
  OpenStack Release Team, a member of `neutron-release
  <https://review.openstack.org/#/admin/groups/150,members>`_ `tags the release
  <http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/drivers.html#tagging-a-release>`_ and
  creates the needed stable branches, if needed.  Note: tagging will release
  the code to PyPI. Note: new major tag versions should conform to SemVer
  requirements, meaning no year numbers should be used as a major version. The
  switch to SemVer is advised at earliest convenience for all new major
  releases.
* The Neutron release liaison votes with +1 for the openstack/releases patch
  that gives indication to release team the patch is ready to merge.
* The releases will now be on PyPI. A sub-project owner should verify this by
  going to an URL similar to
  `this <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networking-odl>`_.
* A sub-project owner should next go to Launchpad and release this version
  using the "Release Now" button for the release itself.
* If a sub-project uses the "delay-release" option, a sub-project owner should
  update any bugs that were fixed with this release to "Fix Released" in
  Launchpad.  This step is not necessary if the sub-project uses the
  "direct-release" option, which is the default.  [#jeepyb_release_options]_
* The new release will be available on `OpenStack Releases
  <http://docs.openstack.org/releases/>`_.
* A sub-project owner should add the next milestone to the Launchpad series, or
  if a new series is required, create the new series and a new milestone.
* Finally a sub-project owner should send an email to the openstack-announce
  mailing list announcing the new release.

.. note::

    You need to be careful when picking a git commit to base new releases on.
    In most cases, you'll want to tag the *merge* commit that merges your last
    commit in to the branch.  `This bug`__ shows an instance where this mistake
    was caught.  Notice the difference between the `incorrect commit`__ and the
    `correct one`__ which is the merge commit.  ``git log 6191994..22dd683
    --oneline`` shows that the first one misses a handful of important commits
    that the second one catches.  This is the nature of merging to master.

To make a branch end of life, follow the following steps:

* A member of neutron-release will abandon all open change reviews on
  the branch.
* A member of neutron-release will push an EOL tag on the branch.
  (eg. "icehouse-eol")
* A sub-project owner should request the infrastructure team to delete
  the branch by sending an email to the infrastructure mailing list, not by
  bothering the infrastructure team on IRC.
* A sub-project owner should tweak jenkins jobs in project-config if any.
