deprecations:
  - The 'supported_pci_vendor_devs' option is deprecated in Newton and will
    be removed in Ocata. The validation of supported pci vendors is done in
    nova-scheduler through the pci_passthrough_whitelist option when it
    selects a suitable hypervisor, hence the option is considered redundant.
