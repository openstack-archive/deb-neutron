upgrade:
    - The network_device_mtu option is removed. Existing
      users of the option are advised to adopt new
      configuration options to accommodate for their
      underlying physical infrastructure. The relevant
      options are global_physnet_mtu for all plugins,
      and also path_mtu and physical_network_mtus for ML2.
