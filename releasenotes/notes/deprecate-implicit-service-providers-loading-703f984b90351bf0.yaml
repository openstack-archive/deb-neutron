deprecations:
    - Neutron controller service currently allows to load ``service_providers``
      options from some files that are not passed to it via --config-dir or
      --config-dir CLI options. This behaviour is now deprecated and will be
      disabled in Ocata. Current users are advised to switch to aforementioned
      CLI options.
