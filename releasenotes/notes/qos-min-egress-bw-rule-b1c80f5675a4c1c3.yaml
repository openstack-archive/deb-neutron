features:
  - Users can now apply a QoS rule to a port or network to
    setup the minimum egress bandwidth per queue and port.
    The minimum egress bandwidth rule is applied to each port
    individually.
other:
  - At the time of writing, Neutron bandwidth booking is not
    integrated with Compute scheduler, which means that minimal
    bandwidth is not guaranteed but provided as best effort.
