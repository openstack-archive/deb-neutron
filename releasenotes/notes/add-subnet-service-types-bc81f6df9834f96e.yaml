features:
  - Subnets now have a new property 'service_types'.
    This is a list of port device owners, such that
    only ports with a matching device owner will be
    given an IP from this subnet. If no matching
    service subnet exists for the given device owner,
    or no service subnets have been defined on the
    network, the port will be assigned an IP from a
    subnet with no service-types. This preserves
    backwards compatibility with older deployments.
upgrade:
  - A new table 'subnet_service_types' has been added
    to cater for this feature. It uses the ID field
    from the 'subnets' table as a foreign key.
