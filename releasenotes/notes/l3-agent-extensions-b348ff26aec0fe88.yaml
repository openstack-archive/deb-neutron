features:
  - The neutron L3 agent now has the ability to load
    agent extensions, which allows other services to
    integrate without additional agent changes.  An 
    API for exposing the l3 agent's router info data 
    to the extensions is also provided so that 
    extensions can remain consistent with router
    state.
