features:
  - net-mtu extension now recalculates network MTU on each network access, not
    just on creation. It now allows operators to tweak MTU related
    configuration options and see them applied to all network resources right
    after controller restart, both old and new.
upgrade:
  - Existing networks with MTU values that don't reflect configuration
    will receive new MTU values after controller upgrade. Note that to
    propagate new correct MTU values to your backend, you may need to resync
    all agents that set up ports, as well as re-attach VIFs to affected
    instances.
